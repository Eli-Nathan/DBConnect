# DBConnect

Simple PHP DB connection script.

### Get started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a database in your mysql client. I've called mine `db`.
3. Run the `/db_schema/example-users.sql` file to get a load of expample users in a table.

### Run

On OSX, in the terminal, `cd` into the project.
Run:
```shell
php -S localhost:8888```

Now you can go to localhost:8888 and see your project running.
